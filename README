John Bogart - jgb128

This is a redone version of Project 2 - Shell Terminal, for Systems Programming (CS 214).
I redid this assignment because I was unhappy with my grade. I felt restrained in some ways by the time crunch my partner put upon me, therefore I did this version completely alone.
Almost 0 code is reused from the first iteration as I wanted to ensure that I learned the key concepts that this project taught.

Extensions:
All

Testing Plan: (located under scripts/)
    batchin1.sh - This creates a subdirectory and calls echo to redirect the input to a new file in that subdirectory.
        cat then reads the contents of the file before the entire directory is removed recursively.
    
    batchin2.sh - This is the same as batchin1.sh, however it doesn't write to a file as file redirection is not implemented yet. This is for testing purposes only and will be redone.

    wildcardTest.sh - Runs tests to ensure wildcards work along with wildcard directories.

    redirectTest.sh - Runs tests to ensure basic file redirection works

    advancedTest.sh - Runs tests of advanced features such as no space between redirection to ensure tokenization, or redirecting pwd
